# Observational Realism

First get a  `CANFAR` account and then install the Canadian Astronomy Data Center (CADC) `vos` collection of packages/tools. I installed it in a conda environment and dumped it to `cfis.yml` if you want to use the same environment that I used (recommended, so that I can debug for you). Otherwise, `vos` can be installed via `pip`:

    pip install -U vos
    
or by following any of the instructions here: https://pypi.org/project/vos/

### Compatibility
Tested with Python 3 only. Tested with `Python 3.6.3`. `vos` is currently not compatible with `Python 3.7.x`.
