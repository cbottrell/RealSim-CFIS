'''
Create photometric images from SKIRT IFS datacube.
Version 0.1

SED to flux conversions use the AB system following the documentation here: http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/research/mags-fluxes/
Also found here (though incorrect in places): http://mfouesneau.github.io/docs/pyphot/

Update History:

Version 0.1 - Corrected to explicitly account for the target redshift by stretching the emitted spectrum by the redshift factor and reducing the specific intensities by a factor of (1+z)**5. Now requires a redshift as input in addition to image properties. The output image AB surface brightnesses have already been scaled to account for the target redshift. ObsRealism should not then apply any brightness factor.

    Generate idealized mock photometric images with same spatial scale as the original datacube. The input is a SKIRT data cube with units specific intensity units W/m2/micron/arcsec2. This code is provided as a companion to the Realism suite as it produces output in the exact format accepted by the suite.
    
    "_outputName - formattable string: Should be a formattable string which can be updated for each band (e.g. Outputs/photo_{}.fits).
    
    "wl_filename" - string: Path to wavelength file accompanied with SKIRT. The file should show provide the wavelengths for which each specific intensity in the datacubes is defined.
    
    "bands" - list object: Options are 'u','g','r','i','z', but depends on how much of the spectrum is modelled by SKIRT. Additionally, care should also be taken when interpreting 'u' or 'z' band fluxes because response functions in these bands are strongly (and non-uniformly) affected by atmospheric absorption which is not explicitly modelled.
